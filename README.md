# Coursera's "*Tensorflow: Advanced Techniques Specialisation*": My Code

This repo contains the code I wrote whilst doing Coursera's "*Tensorflow: Advanced Techniques Specialisation*". I 
wrote it to learn the material.

The code is not written to be production-ready - it's my rough work.  

## requirements.yml

**requirements.yml** contains the full specification of the conda environment that was used to run the code.

Command below will create a conda environment specified in the **requirements.yml** file

```
conda env create -f requirements.yml
```
